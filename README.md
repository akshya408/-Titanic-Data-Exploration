# ðŸ“Š Titanic Dataset Exploration
Objective:

âœ… Visual Insights:

Pairplot:

Younger passengers were more likely to survive.

Higher Fare correlates slightly with higher survival.

Heatmap (Correlation):

Fare has a moderate positive correlation with Survived.

Pclass is negatively correlated with Survived (lower class = lower survival).

Age has a weak negative correlation with survival.

Histogram (Age):

Most passengers are between 20â€“40 years old.

Slight right-skewness (more younger people).

Boxplot (Age vs Pclass):

1st class passengers are generally older.

3rd class passengers include more children.

Scatterplot (Age vs Fare, by Survival):

Survivors cluster at higher fares and younger/middle ages.

Some low-fare survivors exist (possible crew or exceptions).
